# Analysis of Unemployment, Poverty, and Life Expectancy in Bay Area, California with Vital Signs Data

## Background
An [editorial by the Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0207-baltimore-poverty-20190205-story.html) provided arguments for how a focus on poverty in Baltimore could solve a wide array of the issues in the city. The article mentions that multiple issues in the city can be correlated to poverty. For instance, people may turn to crimes like burglary at a higher rate if they have less economic security, and feel the need to engage in it for financial reasons. Moreover, The Baltimore City Health Department that poverty has been correlated with health issues as well. The article states that “people in low-income neighborhoods such as Upton Druid Heights consistently have more health problems … than people in wealthier areas such as Roland Park.” The fact that household income has consequences beyond what one may initially think, like health and crime rates, makes this a very important and interesting metric to delve into.

[CBS Baltimore](https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2017/07/06/life-expectancy-baltimore/) stated there are discrepancies in terms of life-expectancy in different areas of Baltimore. In fact, poorer areas of Baltimore had a life expectancy that was 20-years lower than that of richer areas. Lower life expectancy in poorer areas indicate that people are dying prematurely when these are preventable solutions, as those in richer areas are not dying so early. This problem is important as obviously we would like to create for a more equitable society, where people's livelihoods are not affected based on where they live- especially if there are ways to do so. 

In order to further corroborate the trends and effectiveness of a solution of Universal Basic Income (UBI) we are pitching to Baltimore City, Bay Area, California was looked into. Unemployment is often one of the most common causes known for poverty worldwide, per an article [https://www.borgenmagazine.com/unemployment-creates-poverty/]. If there is not such a direct relationship between the two, there is more evidence for the need for UBI. If the unemployment rate in a region turns out not to be high, even with high rates of poverty, this could indicate that getting more disposable income is more of an effective solution to combating poverty than more jobs. 

We found articles about a relationship between life expectancy and poverty, but were not able to confirm trends for ourselves. Looking into whether we can confirm the trend between the two in Bay Area, California. This is a wider data set, so the results can apply to Baltimore City.


A look into Open Data from [Vital Signs](https://www.vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/) for unemployment rate, poverty rate, and life expectancy data in Bay Area, California  will provide the means for comparison and corroboration with Baltimore City data on life expectancy and one of our proposed solutions, UBI.
