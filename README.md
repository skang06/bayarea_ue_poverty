# Analysis of Unemployment, Poverty, and Life Expectancy in Bay Area, California with Vital Signs Data

## Background

- compared Cali to bmore in terms of ue and pov in cities
- the trends don't fall as expected - more pov means more ue
- need for ubi for people bc even if they are employed, they are below pov- demonstrates need for more income in general

- life expectancy and poverty rate
- there is a relationship between the two
- before we weren't able to prove this relationship because didn't have the data, but got the data that shows the trend accurately.

The metric of household income is an important contributor to many different aspects of life. An [editorial by the Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0207-baltimore-poverty-20190205-story.html) provided arguments for how a focus on poverty in Baltimore could solve a wide array of the issues in the city. The article mentions that multiple issues in the city can be correlated to poverty. For instance, people may turn to crimes like burglary at a higher rate if they have less economic security, and feel the need to engage in it for financial reasons. Moreover, The Baltimore City Health Department that poverty has been correlated with health issues as well. The article states that “people in low-income neighborhoods such as Upton Druid Heights consistently have more health problems … than people in wealthier areas such as Roland Park.” The fact that household income has consequences beyond what one may initially think, like health and crime rates, makes this a very important and interesting metric to delve into.

A look into Open Data from [Vital Signs](https://www.vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/) for unemployment rate, poverty rate, and life expectancy data in Bay Area, California  will provide the means for comparison and corroboration with Baltimore City data on life expectancy and one of our proposed solution of UBI.
